This project is centered around crafting a hybrid methodology for the generation of architectural floor plans by harnessing the capabilities of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Autoencoders. The primary objective is to capitalize on the unique strengths of both models to produce a spectrum of diverse and realistic floor plans. This endeavor contributes significantly to the interdisciplinary domains of artificial intelligence, computer vision, and architecture.
